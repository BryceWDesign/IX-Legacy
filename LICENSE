Copyright (c) 2026 Bryce Lovell.
All rights reserved.

This Evaluation License (“License”) governs use of the IX-Legacy repository and all
associated materials, including source code, documentation, schematics, diagrams,
BOMs, CAD files, test procedures, and any other content provided in this repository
(collectively, the “Materials”).

1) DEFINITIONS
“Licensor” means Bryce Lovell.
“You” means the individual or entity exercising permissions under this License.
“Evaluation Use” means non-production, internal activities strictly for the purpose of:
(a) reviewing, compiling, running, testing, benchmarking, validating, auditing, and
(b) making internal notes or internal modifications necessary to evaluate feasibility,
performance, safety, and engineering characteristics.
“Evaluation Results” means outputs and observations derived from Evaluation Use,
including measurements, plots, logs, performance numbers, test reports, and conclusions,
but excluding the Materials themselves and any substantial portion of the Materials.
“Commercial Use” means any use that is primarily intended for, or results in:
(i) sale, licensing, distribution, commercialization, monetization, or revenue;
(ii) deployment in production environments (including field deployment beyond controlled
evaluation), or embedding into products, services, systems, or platforms offered to others;
(iii) providing a hosted service / SaaS / “as a service” offering using the Materials;
(iv) manufacturing, offering for sale, or distributing hardware based on the Materials.

2) GRANT OF RIGHTS (EVALUATION ONLY)
Subject to full compliance with this License, Licensor grants You a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to:
a) Access and use the Materials solely for Evaluation Use.
b) Make a reasonable number of copies strictly as needed for Evaluation Use.
c) Modify the Materials solely for Evaluation Use, provided such modifications remain
internal and are not distributed or disclosed outside Your organization except as permitted
by Section 4.

3) RESTRICTIONS
You MAY NOT, and You agree not to:
a) Use the Materials for any Commercial Use.
b) Deploy the Materials in production or operational environments.
c) Distribute, publish, share, sublicense, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise make the Materials
(or any portion) available to any third party, except as permitted in Section 4.
d) Distribute or publish derivatives, forks, or modified versions of the Materials.
e) Remove or alter copyright notices, authorship attributions, or this License.
f) Use the Materials to develop or improve a competing product or system intended for
Commercial Use without Licensor’s prior written permission.

4) LIMITED SHARING FOR EVALUATION (EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VALIDATION LABS)
You may disclose the Materials solely for Evaluation Use to:
a) Your employees; and
b) Your contractors, consultants, affiliates, or third-party validation/testing laboratories
acting on Your behalf (“Authorized Evaluators”),
ONLY if ALL of the following are true:
1) Authorized Evaluators are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as protective
as this License; and
2) Authorized Evaluators are restricted to Evaluation Use only; and
3) You remain fully responsible for their compliance; and
4) No further redistribution occurs beyond those Authorized Evaluators.

5) PUBLICATION OF EVALUATION RESULTS (ALLOWED; MATERIALS NOT ALLOWED)
You may publish or share Evaluation Results (e.g., performance numbers, plots, test reports)
provided that:
a) You do NOT include or disclose the Materials, source code, schematics, CAD, BOMs,
or any substantial portion of the Materials; and
b) You do NOT include enough detail to reconstruct the Materials; and
c) You include attribution: “Evaluation performed on IX-Legacy by Bryce Lovell”; and
d) You do not imply Licensor endorsement; and
e) You comply with any separate NDA you may have with Licensor (if applicable).

For clarity: publishing Evaluation Results does NOT grant any right to Commercial Use.

6) FEEDBACK (OPTIONAL)
If You provide feedback, suggestions, or test results (“Feedback”) to Licensor, You grant
Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right to use that Feedback to improve the
Materials. Feedback does not grant You any additional rights beyond this License.

7) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; NO PATENT LICENSE
The Materials are licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all right, title, and interest.
No patent rights are granted under this License. No trademark rights are granted.

8) CONFIDENTIALITY (RECOMMENDED)
Licensor recommends treating the Materials as confidential. This License does not itself
create an NDA, but nothing here prevents You and Licensor from executing an NDA or
commercial agreement.

9) TERMINATION
This License is effective until terminated. It terminates automatically upon any breach.
Upon termination, You must cease all use and destroy all copies of the Materials and any
derivatives in Your possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by law.

THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK.

11) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DAMAGES (DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE MATERIALS OR THIS LICENSE.

12) PRODUCTION / COMMERCIAL LICENSE
If You want to manufacture, deploy, distribute, or commercialize any system based on the
Materials, You must obtain a separate written license from Licensor.
